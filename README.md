# Image Vector Converter

This project demonstrates how to convert raster images (like JPG or PNG) into vector graphics (SVG) using Google Colab. It includes:

- Uploading or generating a sample image
- Converting the image to black & white bitmap format (PBM)
- Vectorizing the bitmap to SVG using Potrace
- Converting SVG to PNG and PDF formats
- Downloading all output files
- Creating a downloadable ZIP package of the project files

## Sample Image

A simple `sample_input.jpg` is included (or generated) — a white 512×512 image with a black square in the center. This image works well for testing vectorization.

## How to Use

1. Open the `image_vector_converter.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cell that generates or uploads an image.
3. Run cells step-by-step to convert the image to SVG.
4. Download the SVG, PNG, PDF files or the whole ZIP package.
